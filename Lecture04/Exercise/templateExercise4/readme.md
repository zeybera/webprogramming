### Exercise 4: Enhancing the Piano Game with JavaScript Objects and AJAX

#### Objective
The goal of this exercise is to extend the functionality of the Piano Game by utilizing JavaScript objects and AJAX (fetch API). Instead of hardcoding musical notes, students will dynamically load note sequences from a JSON file and process them within the game.

#### Task Description
1. **Piano Key Representation** (1 point)
   - Define piano keys as JavaScript objects, storing their relevant properties such as musical note and corresponding keyboard key.
   
2. **Dynamic Note Loading** (1 point)
   - Retrieve musical note sequences from an external JSON file using the fetch API. The loaded data should be processed and made available for interactive use within the game.

3. **User Interaction** (1 point)
   - Implement interactive controls that allow users to trigger piano notes by either pressing designated keys on the keyboard or clicking on the displayed piano keys.
   
4. **Reset Functionality** (1 point)
   - Provide a mechanism to reset the game state, clearing active styles or effects and preparing the interface for a new session.

#### Achievement Criteria
To successfully complete this exercise, students must:
1. Load note sequences dynamically from a JSON file instead of hardcoding them.
2. Represent piano keys as objects and process them efficiently.
3. Enable user interaction via keyboard input and mouse clicks to play notes.
4. Implement a reset function that clears active states and allows restarting the game seamlessly.

#### Optional Enhancements
- Support multiple songs by allowing selection from different JSON files.
- Improve visual and audio effects for a more immersive experience.
- Implement sustained notes when keys are held down for a longer duration.
