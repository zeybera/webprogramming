# Week 5 Exercise: Converting the Piano Game to TypeScript

## **Objective**
The goal of this exercise is to **refactor the JavaScript-based Piano Game into TypeScript** by adding type annotations, defining interfaces, and setting up a TypeScript configuration file. By the end of this exercise, students will better understand **type safety, improved code structure, and maintainability** using TypeScript.

Successfully completing this exercise will earn **5 points**.

---

## **Task Description**

### **Task 1: Set Up TypeScript (1 Point)**
- Install TypeScript and configure it in the project.
- Generate and modify the TypeScript configuration file.
- Organize the project structure by creating a source folder for TypeScript files.

### **Task 2: Add Type Annotations (2 Points)**
- Define type annotations for core game variables.
- Test and observe TypeScript’s type inference.
- Ensure TypeScript prevents incorrect assignments.

### **Task 3: Define Interfaces for `PianoKey` (2 Points)**
- Create an interface to define the properties of a piano key.
- Convert the existing `PianoKey` class to use TypeScript.
- Ensure that type safety is enforced when creating new piano key instances.

---

## **Submission Requirements**
- Submit the TypeScript project as a **ZIP file via Moodle** or provide a GitHub repository link.
- The submission must include:
  1. **Project Setup**: Properly configured TypeScript environment.
  2. **Typed Variables**: Type annotations applied where necessary.
  3. **Typed `PianoKey` Class**: Interface usage and structured class implementation.
  4. **Typed Event Listeners**: Properly annotated event handlers ensuring type safety.

---

## **Optional Enhancements**
- Extend the implementation by creating a class to manage multiple piano keys.
- Implement a method to play a sequence of notes with proper state updates.
- Introduce an enumeration to manage musical note values with type safety.

---

## **Learning Objectives**
By completing this exercise, students will:
- Understand how **TypeScript improves code safety and structure**.
- Gain hands-on experience in **converting JavaScript to TypeScript**.
- Learn how to **define interfaces, annotate variables, and handle events safely**.

Good luck and happy coding! 🎵
